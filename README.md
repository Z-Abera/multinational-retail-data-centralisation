""" The project objective is to centralised the sales data for an organisations. 
    The data needs to be accessible by team members of the organisation. You work for a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe.

The first goal will be to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data.

Then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

Milestone 3

The tables, dim_users_table, dim_store_details, dim_products, dim_date_times, dim_card_details were casted to the correct data types.
Primary and foreign keys were created to link to the master table orders_table.
